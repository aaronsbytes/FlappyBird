# Why?

I had an internship for which i had to make some C# applications. This is one of the projects i came up with.

# Credits
I used [WPF-Flappy-Bird-Game](https://github.com/mooict/WPF-Flappy-Bird-Game?tab=readme-ov-file) from [mooict](https://github.com/mooict) as the starting point since i didn't have a clue how to even change the positon of elements without using margins (ðŸ¤®).
